                <h2 class="center-title">Here's a time line of Sir Winston Churchill's life:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Churchill was born at his parental home, Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, on 30 November 1874</li>
                    <li>He made three attempts to be admitted to the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, only succeeding on the third. He was accepted as a cadet in the cavalry, starting his education in September 1893</li>
                    <li>Churchill sailed from Southampton to South Africa as a journalist writing for the Daily Mail and Morning Post.</li>
                    <li>He was captured as a prisoner of war and interned in a Boer POW camp in Pretoria</li>
                    <li>Conservative candidate for the seat of Oldham at the 1900 general election, securing a narrow victory.[99] At the age of 25, he was now an MP.</li>
                    <li>MPs were not then paid a wage, and to earn money Churchill embarked on a speaking tour focusing on his South African experiences; after touring Britain in late October and November he proceeded to the US, where his first lecture was introduced by the writer Mark Twain</li>
                    <li>Churchill proposed marriage to Clementine Hozier;[170] they were married in September at St Margaret's, Westminster.</li>
                    <li>On 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany following the outbreak of the Second World War, Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, the same position he had held during the first part of the First World War</li>
                    <li> His first as prime minister was the famous "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat" speech. One historian has called its effect on Parliament "electrifying"</li>
                    <li>The war energised Churchill, who was 65 years old when he became Prime Minister. Stating that he was the only top leader from World War I who still had an important political job, John Gunther wrote that Churchill "looks ten years younger than he is".</li>
                    <li>Churchill's good relations with United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt—between 1939 and 1945 they exchanged an estimated 1700 letters and telegrams and met 11 times</li>
                    <li>When Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, Winston Churchill, a vehement anti-communist, famously stated "If Hitler invaded Hell, I would at least make a favourable reference to the Devil in the House of Commons", regarding his policy towards Stalin.</li>
                    <li>In June 1944,Churchill broadcast to the nation that Germany had surrendered and that a final ceasefire on all fronts in Europe would come into effect at one minute past midnight that night</li>
                    <li>After the general election of October 1951, Churchill again became prime minister, and his second government lasted until his resignation in April 1955</li>
                    <li>Churchill had suffered a mild stroke while on holiday in the south of France in the summer of 1949. By the time he formed his next government he was slowing down noticeably enough for George VI, as early as December 1951, to consider inviting Churchill to retire in the following year in favour of Anthony Eden,but it is not recorded if the King made that approach before his own death in February 1952</li>
                    <li>The strain of carrying the Premiership and Foreign Office contributed to his second stroke at 10 Downing Street after dinner on the evening of 23 June 1953. Despite being partially paralysed down one side, he presided over a Cabinet meeting the next morning without anybody noticing his incapacity</li>
                    <li>Elizabeth II offered to create Churchill Duke of London, but this was declined as a result of the objections of his son Randolph, who would have inherited the title on his father's death.He did, however, accept a knighthood as Garter Knight. </li>
                    <li>Churchill spent most of his retirement at Chartwell and at his home in Hyde Park Gate, in London, and became a habitué of high society on the French Riviera.</li>
                    <li>On 15 January 1965, Churchill suffered a severe stroke and died at his London home nine days later, aged 90, on the morning of Sunday, 24 January 1965, 70 years to the day after his own father's death</li>
                    <li>The funeral was the largest state funeral in world history up to that time, with representatives from 112 nations; only China did not send an emissary. In Europe, 350 million people, including 25 million in Britain, watched the funeral on television, and only the Republic of Ireland did not broadcast it live.</li>
